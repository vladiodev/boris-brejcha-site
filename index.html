				Boris Brejcha (born November 26, 1981 in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Rhineland-Palatinate) is a German DJ and record producer. He describes his music style as "High-Tech Minimal."[1] He uses the "joker mask" as his signature look, being inspired by the Carnival in Rio, at the times when he was performing for the first time, in Brazil. [2] Since then, he has been performing at clubs around the world and at some of the biggest festivals such as Tomorrowland, Timewarp and Exit festival. [2] Boris and his friends Ann Clue and Deniz Bul founded the label "Fckng Serious" in 2015.[3] In August, 2019, he performed for the first time in Ibiza at Hï Ibiza club.[4]<br>
				<br>
				At age 6, he was a victim of the Ramstein air show disaster. This left him badly burnt and affected his outlook on life as a whole. He states in an interview; "this was a special incidence in my life. I was alone, I was a little boy and I was in an extreme situation".
				<br><br>
				On the 24 January 2020, Brejcha released his 6th album Space Diver. It is his first album for Ultra Records.
